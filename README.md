tigervnc
========

GitHub clone of SVN repo https://tigervnc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tigervnc (cloned by http://svn2github.com/)

I was sick of the many and increasing number of annoying bugs in remmina.
But I loved the way they handle the keyboard grab with Control_R. So, a added a hack to tigervnc_1_2_0 which does the same here and now I'm very happy with it.
